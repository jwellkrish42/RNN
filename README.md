# RNN_network
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using TensorFlow and Keras. RNNs are designed for processing sequential data, making them powerful tools for tasks involving time series, text, or any kind of sequence modeling.

 Project Highlights:
 
Builds and trains an RNN model using Keras
Suitable for sequence prediction or classification tasks
Includes data preprocessing and input shaping for RNNs
Visualizes training performance (loss and accuracy)
Evaluates model predictions and generalization

 Technologies Used:
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

 Dataset:
The notebook uses a sample dataset appropriate for sequential modeling — such as:
 synthetic/custom sequences
Replace with actual dataset details if you used one like IMDB, Shakespeare, or stock prices.

 Model Overview:
RNN Layer(s): Vanilla RNN or SimpleRNN from Keras
Loss Function: CrossEntropy or MSE depending on task
Optimizer: Adam or RMSProp
Activation: tanh, softmax, etc.

📈 Example Output:-

Epochs	Accuracy	Loss
10	92.5%	0.14
Includes training curves and predictions vs. true values comparison.

 How to Run:

Clone the repo:-
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rnn-sequence-model.git
cd rnn-sequence-model

Install required packages:-
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Launch the notebook:-
bash
jupyter notebook Recurrent_Neural_Network(RNN).ipynb

 Future Improvements:-
Integrate LSTM or GRU layers
Use pre-trained embeddings (e.g., GloVe)
Expand to sequence-to-sequence modeling or attention-based models
